- **Storage Layer**: Abstract storage interface with in-memory implementation
- **Database Schema**: Users table and contact messages table
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe API requests
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware

### Shared Components
- **Schema Definitions**: Drizzle ORM schemas with Zod validation
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend

## Data Flow

1. **Contact Form Submission**:
   - User fills out contact form in React frontend
   - Form data validated client-side with React Hook Form
   - POST request to `/api/contact` endpoint
   - Server validates with Zod schema
   - Data stored in PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
   - Success/error response sent back to client
   - Toast notification displayed to user

2. **CV Download**:
   - User clicks download button
   - GET request to `/api/download-cv`
   - Server responds with file download headers
   - File served to user's browser

3. **Theme Management**:
   - Theme state managed in React Context
   - Preference persisted in localStorage
   - CSS variables toggled via document class

## External Dependencies

### UI and Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **Class Variance Authority**: Component variant management

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the stack
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool with HMR
- **ESBuild**: Fast backend bundling
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with Autoprefixer

### Database and ORM
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe SQL ORM
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and introspection
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Neon database client

### Form and Validation
- **React Hook Form**: Performant form library
- **Zod**: TypeScript-first schema validation
- **@hookform/resolvers**: Zod integration for React Hook Form

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Mode
- Frontend served via Vite dev server with HMR
- Backend runs via tsx with auto-restart
- Database migrations applied with `npm run db:push`
- Environment variables loaded from `.env` file

### Production Build
- Frontend built to `dist/public` directory
- Backend bundled to `dist/index.js` with ESBuild
- Static files served by Express in production
- Single process deployment with Express serving both API and static files

### Database Management
- PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon (serverless)
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- Migrations generated and applied via Drizzle Kit
- Connection managed via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### Environment Configuration
- Development: Hot reloading, source maps, debug logging
- Production: Optimized bundles, static file serving, error handling
- Database: Automatic SSL connection to Neon PostgreSQL
- CORS: Configured for same-origin requests

The application is designed for easy deployment on platforms like Replit, with a single build command that creates both frontend and backend bundles, and a simple start command that serves the entire application.
